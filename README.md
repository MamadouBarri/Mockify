## About The Project


Often times, front end developers need data to prototype the UI, but the back end is not quite ready to use. Usually this issue is resolved by creating a local mock API, but the process can be tedious and repetitive. In these situations a service like *Mockify* is particularly useful!

Here's why:
* Your time should not be spent creating mock APIs, because they will eventually be replaced :clock10:
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over (DRY!)  :expressionless:
* It's easy! :white_check_mark:

Of course, not all types of data can be mocked with Mockify as of now, but feel free to <a href="https://github.com/MamadouBarri/Mockify/issues">request a feature </a> or even contribute to this project!


### Built With

These are the main technologies used to build and deploy this project:
* [Python 3.8.5](https://www.python.org/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

For a more exhaustive list, feel free to check out the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MamadouBarri/Mockify/blob/master/requirements.txt) file.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

* An HTTP client to make POST requests such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or a library like [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

### Usage

Here is a simple POST request to [https://mockify-api.herokuapp.com/api/](https://mockify-api.herokuapp.com/api/) with a json schema.

```
POST https://mockify-api.herokuapp.com/api/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "count": 100,
    "city": "my_city",
    "country_code": "my_country_code",
    "country_name": "my_country_name",
    "currency": "my_currency",
    "email": "my_email",
    "first_name": "my_first_name",
    "last_name": "my_last_name",
    "phone": "my_phone",
    "state": "my_state",
    "street_address": "my_street_address",
    "zip_code": "my_zip",
    "integer_number": {
        "range": "1,2",
        "name": "my_integer_number"
    },
    "float_number": {
        "range": "1,2.5",
        "name": "my_float_name"
    },
    "list_choice": {
        "range": "asdf, asdf, adf",
        "name": "my_list_choice"
    },
    "boolean_value": "my_boolean",
    "unique_identifier": "my_uid"
}
```

After this request, the server returns a json file containing a list of 100 mock objects with random data:
